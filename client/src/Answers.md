1. Explain what a token is used for.

A token let’s a user access protected pages on a website for a designated period of time. In other words, it’s a security technique to authenticate a username and password once logged in a website.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

There are lots of ways to keep our web apps secure. You can ask professionals to try and attack or hack your application to find security vulnerabilities, study web application security blogs, back up data in the event of a security breach, scan our websites for vulnerabilities more frequently, invest in security experts, sanitizing user inputs, having a strong password policy in place, and so much more! The important thing to remember is to build security into your application as you go and always have it at the forefront of your mind, rather than an afterthought.

3. Describe how web servers work.

Web servers allow us to surf the internet by processing incoming network requests over HTTP. The main purpose of web servers is to store, process, and deliver web pages to clients.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

C = create, which corresponds to the POST HTTP verbage. This let's us create or add data to be displayed.
R = read, which corresponds to the GET HTTP verbage. This let's us fetch and display data.
U = update, which corresponds to the PUT HTTP verbage. This let's us edit our displayed data.
D = delete, which corresponds to the DELETE HTTP verbage. This let's us delete our displayed data.
